Subject: 5‑Day Pilot: Closed‑Loop PQC Enforcement & Verifiable Receipts

Hi <Name>,

We’re helping security teams prove enforcement, not just configure it. Signet gives you:

• Closed‑loop: Policy → Enforcement → Proof (Merkle‑linked receipts)  
• Stability: Control‑theoretic breaker (no brownout flapping)  
• Safety: Rego policy + TLS exporter binding  

Pilot = 5 business days:
Day 1 handshake, Day 3 breaker under stress, Day 5 compliance pack verification.

If you can spare 30 minutes this week, I’ll run the live demo (one PowerShell script). Interested?
